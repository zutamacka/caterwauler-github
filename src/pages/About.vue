        Cats communicate by marking trees, fence posts, or furniture with their
        claws or their waste. These scent posts are meant to inform others of a
        cat's home range. House cats employ a vocal repertoire that extends from
        a purr to a screech.

        Domestic cats remain largely carnivorous, and have evolved a simple gut
        appropriate for raw meat. They also retain the rough tongue that can
        help them clean every last morsel from an animal bone (and groom
        themselves). Their diets vary with the whims of humans, however, and can
        be supplemented by the cat's own hunting successes.
